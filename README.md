# 💰 Actual vs Forecast Budget Analysis Dashboard (IT Firm – 2020 COVID Impact)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This **Power BI dashboard** analyzes the **financial performance of an IT firm in 2020**, comparing **actual costs vs forecasted budgets** across IT areas, cost elements, and regions. Created in the context of **COVID-19 disruptions**, it highlights budget deviations, overspending, and underutilization to support smarter financial planning. 

Here are the key pages of the **Actual vs Forecast Budget Analysis Dashboard**: 

### 1️⃣ Main Dashboard – Jan 2020 YTD  
Provides a **high-level summary of budget vs forecast vs actual performance** with KPIs, variance analysis, and running totals.
